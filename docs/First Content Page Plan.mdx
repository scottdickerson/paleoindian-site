# Overview

This keeps track of the TODOs and plan design for our first content page

## TODO NEXT STEPS

Add the Tooltip component over the text in details (probably takes a component instead of a string)
Get the latest image of the slider
Fix the bug where force reloading a page with a section title not visible doesn't select anything
Can I use the NextJS Image tag for the Slider image instead of the standard img tag?

### Responsive image.

- Has max width and is centered
- If shrunk smaller than max width it should shrink but preserve aspect ratio
- Preserve aspect ration is contain
- Should each image height be manually set or is it the same across the board?
