# Navigation Elements

## TODO:

-   Remove the unselected background from each entry
-   If I launch the page from a URL it might not highlight if the heading's not showing
-   Show the caption in the correct place on the slider,
-   need to dynamically increase the font-size and line-height based on the image width, I'll need to use container media queries!
-   Fade in the second caption in once we pull past a certain configured percentage
