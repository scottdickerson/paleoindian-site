# Navigation Elements

## TODO:

Fix the TOC scrollable to actually line up correctly
I can set a border-radius on top-left and bottom-left separate from right flat
I need to scoot the background image over to the right, make larger and try a box-shadow blur radius behind it

What's the best way to import the `<Image` locally? is it to do a relative import or a local code import?

If I click to scroll up it's highlighting along the way. Maybe best just to launch to it
If I launch the page from a URL it might not highlight if the heading's not showing
Need to fix the background gradient on the page
