# TODO

I'm using handbrake to compress these into git
It's possible that I'll have to pay for a CDN (or ask if Humanities Texas has one) to store the video files on

I've used Email 25MB 3 Minutes 720p30 for now with web optimized and iPod5G support (turn that off?)

Test with disabled cache to see how fast the page loads...

# Is there a way to build a streaming video version of the Video widget?

https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player#multiple-sources-and-tracks if we post the video to youtube, this will allow us to configure segments..
Much cheaper than implementing our own streaming segment player

Might need to split the video into segments so we don't have to download the whole video
