# Overview

Documents all my learning of XD
Ungroup the sections to be able to introspect the various fonts etc.

Variable fonts
You pass font-weight/font-stretch to them and you shouldn't have to load different font files, just one

Pressing Control lets me select individual layers without Ungrouping

## Questions

-   Why are the font weights so different between the XD font and mine?
-   Pulling the linear gradients, the colors are right, but the stop points are not. I also have to explicitly set at 180deg (or `to right`) otherwise it goes from top to bottom
